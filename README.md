# Odin Calculator

## The culmination of the odin projects foundation section

### Description

Here I am, at the end of the foundations section of [The Odin Projects Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) and it's going out with a banger, to take everything that I've worked with through the section and put it together to a nifty home-cooked calculator!

### What is this

The odin calculator is the culmination and testing of the knowledge gathered up to this point from the curriculum.

It is a on-screen calculator made using Javascript, HTML, and CSS!

### Work in Progress

The odin-calculator is still a work in progress, it is definitively useable, but there's still some things i want to add:

- ~~Decimal button: To calculate with decimals. Add a button to the calculator that does this, but only one!~~ (DONE!)
- ~~Backspace button: It came to me that it may be useful to delete mistakes without clearing the entire thing~~(DONE!)
- Keyboard support: I want the user to be able to use their keyboard to type in numbers and operators directly into the input field, and capture/prevent issues like writing letters (abc) or wrong operators (\ instead of /, x instead of \* etc.).

## Check it out!

As usual, check it out yourself!
