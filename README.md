# Odin Calculator

## The culmination of the odin projects foundation section

### Description

Here I am, at the end of the foundations section of [The Odin Projects Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) and it's going out with a banger, to take everything that I've worked with through the section and put it together to a nifty home-cooked calculator!

### What is this

The odin calculator is the culmination and testing of the knowledge gathered up to this point from the curriculum.

It is a on-screen calculator made using Javascript, HTML, and CSS!

## Check it out!

As usual, check it out yourself!
